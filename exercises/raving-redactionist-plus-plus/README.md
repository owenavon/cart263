Exercise 06: Raving Redactionist Plus Plus
Owen Avon

// A hacker is un-censoring top secret information. You must click on the revealed information in order for it to redact as quickly as possible. When you click, take note of the letter that is spoken aloud. Enter the keyword to jam the hacking.

Added functionality:

** Improve the visual presentation by working with the CSS and HTML - Modal instruction box
** Use a fading effect to fade the redaction effect in and out (this will likely require .animate())
** Add an ending of some kind to the experience if the user allows all the secrets to be revealed (“YOU LOST THE COLD WAR!!”) - Annyang! says a letter every time the user clicks on revealed text.
** Custom: Implement a text input field for the user to enter the secret keyword. The Keyword will stop the hacking.
