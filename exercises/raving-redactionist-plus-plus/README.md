Exercise 06: Raving Redactionist Plus Plus
Owen Avon

// A Russian hacker un-censors top secret information in real time. You must click on the revealed information to redact it as quickly as possible. When you click, take note of the letter that is spoken aloud. When prompted, enter the password to terminate the infiltration.

Added functionality:
** Improve the visual presentation (sort of) by working with the CSS and HTML
** Use a fading effect to fade the redaction effect in and out (this will likely require .animate())
** Add an ending of some kind to the experience if the user allows all the secrets to be revealed (“YOU LOST THE COLD WAR!!”)
** Reposition the user as someone trying to get the secrets with an interesting revelation mechanics (maybe if they successfully print the document they win???)
** Custom: Implement a text input field for the user to enter an auditorily observed secret password. The password will stop the hacking
