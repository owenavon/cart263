# Bubble Popper Plus Plus

Exercise 04: Bubble Popper Plus Plus
Owen Avon

// Pop bubbles with your index finger as a pin.

Added functionality:

** Add loading, title, and instructions screens and maybe an “ending” to the program to make it into more of a total package
** Make it increasingly difficult to pop the bubble over time (it could get faster? smaller?) - DONE
** Improve the audiovisual presentation of the program with more interesting visuals and sound effects
** Count how many bubbles the user has popped over time
** Add different types of bubbles (maybe you shouldn’t pop some of them, maybe they all react different to being poked with the pin…)
** Use a different ml5.js feature to represent the pin (could use the Object Detector to require the player uses a pair of scissors? Though you could represent rotation then…)
