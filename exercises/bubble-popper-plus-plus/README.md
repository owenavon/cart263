# Bubble Popper Plus Plus

Exercise 04: Bubble Popper Plus Plus
Owen Avon

// Pop bubbles with your index finger as a pin. Achieve 25 points to win. Don't miss more than two balloons.

Added functionality:

** Add loading, title, and instructions screens and maybe an “ending” to the program to make it into more of a total package
** Make it increasingly difficult to pop the bubble over time (it could get faster? smaller?)
** Improve the audiovisual presentation of the program with more interesting visuals and sound effects
** Count how many bubbles the user has popped over time
