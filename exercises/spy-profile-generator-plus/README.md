# Spy Profile Generator Plus

Exercise 02: Spy Profile Generator Plus
Owen Avon

Generates a randomized spy profile for the user, and password protects it. Ads extra security by asking the user to enter a pin before creating an account, and uses voice recognition to ensure they are human.

Added functionality:

** Added the ability to clear the browser's cache and generate a new account by a button press, with the use of p5.dom.min.js and CSS.
** Implemented voice recognition to allow the user to sign out of their account, by saying "sign out". Instruction displays when "signed in".
** Improve the visual display of the program.
** Allow the user to selectively regenerate specific categories in the profile (by clicking on them? with keyboard keys? with their voice?) to get one they like
