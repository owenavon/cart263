Synopsis:
Inspired from the movie “Cars”, the user plays as "Mator" and has the task of attempting to wake sleeping tractors with the use of their voice. The player must do so cautiously, as there is a fine line between waking up the tractor and earning a point, to disturbing the authority combined figure “Frank”. The user wins if they can “tip” 3 tractors without disturbing Frank.

However, If Frank is disturbed, he will chase "Mator" along the screen for up to 30 seconds. The user who controls "Mator" must avoid all obstacles like fences and hay bales in order to louse Frank and win the objective.
