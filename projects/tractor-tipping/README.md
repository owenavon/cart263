# A Night at the Movies - Tractor Tipping

Project 01: Tractor Tipping
Owen Avon

NOTE: You may need to change the values of minLoudness and maxLoudness to work best with your microphone. I found a discrepancy between my external microphone, and my internal microphone.

Synopsis:
Inspired from the movie “Cars”, the user plays as "Mater" and tasked to tip the sleeping tractors with the use of their voice. The player must do so cautiously, and only honk so loud into the microphone. There is a fine line between honking at an acceptable volume, and tipping the tractors backwards, to honking to loud and the tractor as well as the authority combine figure “Frank”. The user wins if they can “tip” 3 tractors and not get caught from Frank.

Artist Statement:
My vision is to represent the Tractor tipping scene from the movie “Cars”. If unfamiliar, the movie “Cars” is about the life of animated cars, trucks, etc. Therefore, I knew this project would provide a fantastic opportunity to use the Responsive Voice API, as well as p5.AudioIn. In order to tie the game simulation together, I decided to use excerpts from the scene in the movie. I downloaded the clip from YouTube and then cut the specific portions I needed. These portions were then exported as. gifs to allow for easily implementation into p5. The use of the typewriter style animation and ai voice over helped allow the cut scenes to become one with the simulation.

I also wanted to put emphasis on the idea that as the simulation progresses, it becomes later at night. Therefore, I used the same background images throughout, but decreased the blue opacity by 10% each state. It is important to note the prominence of timers in this simulation. All of the cut scenes and may of the proceeding actions are triggers by timers rather then user input. I feel like this helps connect the idea of movie and game into one.
