Purpose:
A web application that allows the user to record their voice, modify the sound with various filters, view the sound waves live as vertical bars, and download the raw recording as a .wav file.

Inspiration:
https://voicechanger.io/
I was Inspired from the website Voice Chnager.io. I thought it would be fun to create an application where the user does not only use their voice to say commands but use their voice to create an individualized experience that creates a form of personalized Interactivity.

Artist Statement:
My vision is to create a web application that provides a simple user experience, while ensuring that it appears as modern, sleek, and simple. This is achieved by formatting the application in a vertical viewport so that it is approachable across various screen sizes, and technology mediums. In addition, I added a border-radius property to most of the div’s to ensure that I was incorporating modern design techniques. Lastly, in relation to visual elements, I ensured that I choose a consistent colour pallet with the use of whites, greys, blacks, and minimal accent colours of green and red.

User Experience
The intention of this project was to create an engaging user experience. Whether the user enjoys the application or not, they are forced to remain engaged since the experience revolves around their voice. All aspects of the application are decided upon the user. Thus, they can decide how to proceed, as there is no set direction. It is not possible to "win" Audio Modio, rather the user must understand that it is to be used as either a practical tool to quickly record microphone input, or as an experimental tool see what happens when effects are dynamically applied by adjusting sliders.

Accomplishments
This project without a doubt was a large undertaking. It pushed my knowledge of JavaScript, jQuery, Responsive Voice, annyang! and Pizzicato and Web Audio API. It showed me how API's work together, and how API’s can become contradictive. I am proud of how I was able to incorporate the Web Audio API, Pizzicato and HTML buttons / input sliders. Despite the application not being Incredibly comprehensive, I believe it is well tied together. Audio-Modio displays an understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JS work together, and how it is important to take advantage of all three-coding language in order to create both technically and artistically pleasing applications.
